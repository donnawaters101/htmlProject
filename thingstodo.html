        <h1>Things To Do</h1>

        <h2>Mexico</h2>

        <p>Mexico go see the Maya Ruins also go to the cenotes and the beaches are must they are spectacular. One of my favorite things to do is to go ziplining over the jungle in Mexico. Also, necessary if you are in Mexico is to go and experience Xcaret it is an amusement theme park. </p>
        

        <h2>Spain</h2>
        <p>Spain is a beautiful country to visit. There is a rich and old history in Spain. You can visit castles, also the flamenco shows are fabulous. The beaches are also beautiful in Spain. A great place to visit in Spain is real Alcazar de Sevilla this museum has been beautifully restored and maintained three historic castles with diverse mosaics. The Alhambra is a must to go and visit. </p>
        
        <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
        <p>Costa Rica this country is vibrant with color and animals. Places to go are La Fortuna waterfall the water is beautiful and fresh. Also, visit Curi Cancha Reserve, it has nature and wildlife areas, it is a forest. Also, necessary is visiting the Royal Butterflies they have some of the most beautiful butterflies in the worlld. </p>

        <h2>Bali</h2>
        <p>Bali is called Island of The Gods due to the fact there are more than 10,000 temples on the island. I highly recommend going to visit Pura Tamam Ayun built-in 1634, translate to ‘beautiful garden’ and that is exactly what it is. Another beautiful temple to visit is Pura Tirta Empul, where you can go, pray, and bathe in the water. It was a very spiritual place. </p>

        <h2>Japan</h2>
        <p>Japan has some of the most amazing views and Buddhist temples to see. I recommend going to Mount Fuji and visiting the temple of Nichiren Shoshu it is one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited. The views are also spectacular and breath taking.</p>
